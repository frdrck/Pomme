><FONT size="+1" color="000"></B>Pomme.Us, Inc. (&ldquo;Pomme.Us&rdquo;) takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy (which we adapted from a policy originally provided by <A href="http://www.automattic.com/">

><FONT size="+3" color="000">Website Visitors </H2
><P 

><FONT size="+1" color="000">Like most website operators, Pomme.Us collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Pomme.Us&rsquo;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Pomme.Us&rsquo;s visitors use its Website. From time to time, Pomme.Us may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website. </P
><P 

>Pomme.Us also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Pomme.Us does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. </P

><FONT size="+3" color="000">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information </H2
><P 

><FONT size="+1" color="000">Certain visitors to the Website choose to interact with Pomme.Us in ways that require Pomme.Us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Pomme.Us gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at Pomme.Us.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Pomme.Us &ndash; by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example &ndash; are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Pomme.Us collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&rsquo;s interaction with Pomme.Us. Pomme.Us does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. </P
><P 

>Pomme.Us does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided Pomme.Us with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at <A href="mailto:info@pomme.us">
<FONT color="031CAA">info@pomme.us</A>
<FONT color="000">. If Pomme.Us becomes aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information. </P

><FONT size="+3" color="000">Aggregated Statistics </H2
><P 

><FONT size="+1" color="000">Pomme.Us may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Website. For instance, Pomme.Us may monitor the most popular blogs on the Pomme.Us.com site to help identify spam. Pomme.Us may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Pomme.Us does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. </P
><P 

><FONT size="+3" color="000">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information </P
><P 

><FONT size="+1" color="000">Pomme.Us discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Pomme.Us&rsquo;s behalf or to provide services available at the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Pomme.Us or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pomme.Us goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Pomme.Us may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, Pomme.Us will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. </P
><P 

>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as described above, Pomme.Us discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Pomme.Us believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Pomme.Us, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Pomme.Us Website and have supplied your email address, Pomme.Us may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&rsquo;s going on with Pomme.Us and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Pomme.Us takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. </P
><P 

>You should also be aware that if you submit information to &ldquo;chat rooms,&rdquo; &ldquo;forums&rdquo; or &ldquo;message boards&rdquo; such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications. </P
><P 

>For users outside the United States, please note that any personally-identifiable information you enter into the Website will be transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to such transfer through your use of the Website. You also warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United States. </P
