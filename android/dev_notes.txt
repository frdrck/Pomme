============================
Implemented basic layout, taking images from Fred's mockup.
Included three views:
  main.xml shows the mock layout
  viewflipper.xml shows a possible way to flip between images.
  gifviewer.xml show a possible way to display gifs

It was surprised that Android doesn't have a native way to show gifs easily.
Gifs must be show in a webview or a movie view.
the current gifviewer doesn't include a background color
I imagine the webview will be the best way to display gifs

It should be easy to use the same server for all web/android/iPhone platforms
all basic data should be JSON
images will be fetched seperately from game data (they won't be JSON)

there should be a simple loading screen
there should be a simple lobby screen
there should be a simple profile screen

I'll ignore favorites, chat and webcam for now

we need to figure out a gesture to "select" cards to play
swiping left and right should flip through cards in hand
perhaps swiping a card up could submit it for play?

there needs to be a Pomme.java class that represents the game state
this will include the score, current player cards, current judge card
once it is created the data from it can be bound to the view.

another class should be created that represents the network layer

perhaps the pomme and network classes could be built as a command line interface
this would be easy to build and test

that's all for now

Some of the JSON that comes from polling a game:

============================
Added a python client that is able to access the server.
I did this some time ago. Just adding an entry to the log here.
